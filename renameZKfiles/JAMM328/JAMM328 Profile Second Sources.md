Currently, Hudak works with Ph.D. students from the University of Idaho. He used his expertise in remote sensing to coach Jessica Stitt, a Ph.D. candidate in Wildlife Biology. He worked with her to develop a research paper called "Evaluating the Use of Lidar to Discern Snag Characteristics Important for Wildlife," published February 2022, in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute's Remote Sensing Journal. 

A dead tree still standing in the forest is known as a snag. Snags are essential for wildlife. Raptors use large snags as nesting platforms, and woodpeckers use the smaller snags. A tree becomes a snag when it dies naturally of old age or gets killed in a forest fire. "People should understand that fire is not evil and shouldn't be vilified," said Stitt.

Stitt's research paper used a mapping technique called Airborne Laser Scanning to identify where and how big the snags were. Stitt's study used plots in forest stands within the Idaho Panhandle National Forest.
