Hudak spends a lot of time considering the impact of his research, working with students and coauthors as a team to write research papers. He is always ready for new challenges. 

"I still have trouble saying no to learning new things," said Hudak. He has the freedom to choose the topics he studies. Hudak works on whatever piques his interest and chooses his collaborators, which is why he loves his work so much.

"One of the draws for a lot of the people that do this kind of work is to be able to be in field and in the woods. When you're out in the field, you remember, 'OK this is why I'm doing it.' Once you are sitting behind a computer, it gets harder and harder to remember 'Why am I analyzing this data?'" said Stitt. Fieldwork gives the freedom of being untethered to email and cell service. Being in the forest is a challenging work component, but collecting the measurements is a powerful draw. 
 
The attention his research has attracted has pushed Hudak out of the field and into the office, and he's swapped the hard hat and work boots for comfortable office attire. "I have less time to do my own analysis now. I do a lot more project management, so I'm in a lot more meetings, I'm often running the meetings." 

As the morning rain passed and the sun poked through the clouds, Hudak swigged the last of his coffee, donned his bicycle helmet, pant leg clips, and rain jacket, then pedaled off towards another project management day at the office.
