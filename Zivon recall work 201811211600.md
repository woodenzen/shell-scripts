Zivon recall work - 2018-11-21

He is coming more dependably as I’m mostly sure that he’ll come before I call him. Saying his name until I have his attention then calling him and clicking the clicker. Encouraging him and rewarding him with a treat and letting him go again. No bad repercussions from coming.
